# Requirements
## Introduction
- A library is a compilation of material and related materials that are made available to a certain group for reference or borrowing. As a result, manually managing a library is time-consuming and inefficient. In this respect, the computerised framework for managing library management operations is a systematic way to minimise human labour, the complexity of the manual system, and soon.
- The aim of this project is to develop and incorporate a computerised library management system. The C programming language was used to develop and execute the library management framework.


## Research
 A **library management system** is a system for library resource planning that is used to view records stored, requests, payment, or lending made by clients. Occasionally, a term such as library integrated framework is used, especially in the _United Kingdom_. Cynthia Lopta describes an interconnected system as a computerised system in which all operating components use the same bibliographic database.  
 
 **Integration** is most commonly seen in biblioteconomy. It became a milestone about 20 years ago and has become almost synonymous with automated device. Integrated may also refer to a method in which all library functions are stored in a single bibliographic register.
 
 By the mid to late 2000s, library management system providers had increased not only the amount of resources available but also their costs, causing some dissatisfaction for many smaller libraries. Simultaneously, the _open source Integrated Library System_ was in its early stages of growth.

 Few libraries have begun to use open source modular library systems such as _**KOHA**_ and _**Evergreen**_. The majority of these factors were to escape vendor lock-up, licencing costs, and to engage in software development. The much-needed vendor independence has encouraged libraries to prioritise needs based on urgency rather than what their vendor might deliver.
 
 Libraries who have recently switched to open source integrated library systems have discovered that providers are now more likely to offer reliable support in order to maintain a relationship when they no longer have the leverage of owning the Integrated Library System programme and binding libraries down to tight contracts. This is what happened with the _**SC LENDS consortium**_. Following the popularity of **Evergreen** with the _**Georgia PINES library consortium**_, _**the South Carolina State Library_** and several local public libraries developed the _**SC LENDS consortium**_ to exchange services and take advantage of the open source nature of the Evergreen Integrated Library System to address their unique needs.
 
 By **October 2015**, just few years after _**SC LENDS's inception**_, thirteen public library systems from 15 states, in addition to the South Carolina State Library, had entered the consortium. Librarytechnology.org conducts an annual survey of over 1,500 libraries and found that in 2012, 2% of those interviewed used the Integrated Library System, 8% in 2013, and 12% in 2014 had implemented an open source Library Management System.

 A library project framework with many versatile and convenient features that allow librarians and library users to optimise time and productivity. The library system has comprehensive information on teachers, employees, and materials, as well as tracking the books that are accessible in the library and the books that have been distributed to library users (students). It displays the most famous books among students. It can have a book that was misplaced in the library. It maintains track of the retailer as well as the book binders.

## Defining Our System

This System has the ability to:

   - Login
   - Show the choices in Main Menu
   - Add Records of the Book
   - Delete Records of the Book
   - Edit Records of Books
   - Search the Records
   - View all the Records

which can be seen in a pictorial representation as follows:

## SWOT ANALYSIS
![SWOT](https://github.com/VelampudiRohit-292119/LTTSProject/blob/main/1_Requirements/SWOT_Analysis.jpg)

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

- All Libraries, for maintaining records of their books.

## What:

- It is tough for the Librarians to handle the maintenance the records of all books in their Library. This will help them to maintain the records.

## When:

- In early 2000's, The need of a Digital way of managing, maintaining the records of Libraries. Thus, This system came into the picture.

## Where:

- All around the world.

## How:

- There has been a lot of cases where the manual records were not in a position to access, thus not able to know about the issues and returns of books. Using this system, we can eliminate that possibility.
